## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/               # Static assets (images, fonts, favicon)
│   ├── assets/          # Images for blog posts
│   └── fonts/           # Web fonts
├── src/
│   ├── assets/          # Icons and images used in components
│   ├── components/      # Reusable UI components
│   │   └── ui/          # React components
│   ├── content/         # Content collections
│   │   └── blog/        # Blog posts in Markdown format (organized by year)
│   ├── layouts/         # Page layouts and templates
│   ├── pages/           # Routes and pages
│   ├── styles/          # Global styles and CSS
│   └── utils/           # Utility functions
├── astro.config.mjs     # Astro configuration
├── vercel.json          # Vercel deployment and CSP configuration
├── package.json         # Project dependencies and scripts
├── tailwind.config.mjs  # Tailwind CSS configuration
└── LICENSE              # Dual license (CC BY 4.0 + MIT)
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
